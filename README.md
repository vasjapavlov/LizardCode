# LizardCode
Solution and test case generator for CodeFu (www.codefu.mk) contests.

USER GUIDE

Copy the full text of a codefu problem , together with the test cases,
into the file "input.txt" . 

Save it and then run the file "LizardCode.exe". 

A file output.txt will be created. Copy the contents of that file into
your compiler and start coding!

Note: make sure "input.txt" and "LizardCode.exe" are in the same 
folder/location.

Source code is in LizardCode.cpp(if you're interested :D )
